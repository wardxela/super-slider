# Super-Slider.js

This is an implementation of the classic infinite slider. This project is based on [cconceicao's amazing article](https://link.medium.com/TtyNhAcAGib). I just tried to create the same functionality using OOP in JavaScript and improve the responsiveness of the component.
The Slider still has some troubles though so I don't recommend using it in the real-world projects.
